#ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS

# Naming of Keys:
# Keys are named in the following format: ITEMCLASS(_SUBCLASS)*_ITEMTYPE
# The above naming pattern uses the common syntax where brackets indicate
# that an item is optional, and that an asterisk indicates that any number
# of any item can be present.
# Here, this patern usually takes the form of ITEMCLASS being one of:
#    MB (short for Menu Button)     : Text for one of the items in the top menu of ANDIE
#    AB (Short for Action Button)   : Text for an action button in one of the submenus of a menu button
#    DS (Short for Description)     : Text for a description for an action button
#    PU (Short for Popup)           : Text that's part of a popup for an action button
#    ER (Short for Error)           : Text that's part of an error message
# 
# Then, the ITEMCLASS will usually be followed by a 'SUBMENUNAME' for action buttons
# Finally the ITEMTYPE will be some short name to further identify the key
